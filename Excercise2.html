                Hi! My name is Rhythm James P. Alarcon. An incoming 1st year student from Ateneo De Davao University, taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                Has a good interpersonal and leadership skills and is a flexible and versatile person that is willing to take variety of roles in an institution, organization, or company.
                I am a keen reader of novels and history books as I have a strong interest in Egyptian History and classical architecture. I love to read books that refer to the rich history and civilization of ancient Egypt.  
                At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.
