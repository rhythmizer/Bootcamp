                </br><strong>MANILA, Philippines</strong> â€” People as young as 18 years old may now legally smoke e-cigarettes and use other vaping products under the controversial <u>"Vape Bill"</u> that lapsed into law on Monday with neither a veto nor a signature from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
                </br>The new law, ratified last January by the Senate and the House in the previous Congress, is seen to have wide health and trade implications in the Philippines, where an estimated 16.6 million adult Filipinos use tobacco, according to the <em>Department of Health (DOH).</em>

                    <em>The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</em> has created a global health crisis that had a deep impact on the way we perceive our
                    world and our everyday lives. Not only has the rate of contagion and patterns of transmission threatened our sense of agency, 
                    but the safety measures to contain the spread of the virus also required social and physical distancing, preventing us from finding solace in the company of others.
